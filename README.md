#Ping Game
<h3>I tried to mimic/clone a very famous and one of the first web games made in history using vanilla js.</h3>

#Features
<h3>A simple UI with both Single and Multiplayer modes</h3>
<h3>A current live scoreboard between you and the player you play against</h3>
<h3>An ongoing game can be paused using the 'p' key whenever every you want</h3>
<h3>An ongoing game can be restarted just by pressing the 'r' key on the keyboard</h3>
<h3>One player can use the arrows up and down to move the paddle and other player can use the 'w' and 's' keys to move up and down respectively</h3>

#How it's made
<h3>just using the canvas feature provided by Js</h3>
